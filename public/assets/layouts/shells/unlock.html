                    <li>You have read and understood all warnings regarding the offline nature of E-Cash.</li>
                    <li>You understand E-Cash exists only on your device and cannot be recovered if lost.</li>
                    <li>You accept full responsibility for safeguarding access credentials and device security.</li>

                    NATURE OF E-CASH
                </h3><br>
                <p>
                    E-Cash is <strong>not paper money, not a digital bank account, and does not rely on blockchain or centralized systems.</strong> Each E-Cash instance exists as a unique offline construct, accessible only via its designated program and internal reference. <strong>It is tied to your device and cannot be duplicated, transferred, or recovered outside its intended environment.</strong>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    E-Cash data is stored as a collapsed entropic state in your device. It can only re-emerge when accessed through the proper mechanism provided by the app. <strong>If the local storage is cleared, corrupted, or the device is lost, the E-Cash is permanently lost.</strong>
                </p><br>
                <h3>
                    RIGHT TO USE
                </h3><br>
                <p>
                    The Client is granted the right to use E-Cash solely for offline transactions using the app’s intended interface and mechanisms. The Client shall not attempt to extract, copy, or replicate E-Cash outside the designed offline framework.

                    CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Ensure your device is secure and accessible only to authorized users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Never clear, reset, or alter the app’s local storage containing E-Cash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passcodes and Access Credentials:</strong> Keep your app passcode or access credentials safe. <strong>If lost or forgotten, the app cannot restore access or recover E-Cash.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Verification:</strong> Confirm offline transactions are correctly received before considering them final.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backup Awareness:</strong> No online or external backup exists; you are fully responsible for maintaining access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negligence:</strong> Any loss caused by careless handling, accidental deletion, or misuse is solely the Client’s responsibility.</li>
