		<h1 class="title"><a href="#How-do-virtual-experience-works">How do virtual experience works?</a></h1>
		<div class="content">
			<div class="wrapper">
				<p>Virtual experiences blend cutting-edge technology with immersive storytelling to transport users into digital worlds that feel remarkably real, all without leaving their physical space.</p>
				<p>At the core, virtual experiences use <strong>Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>, or <strong>Web-based 3D environments</strong> to simulate environments, interactions, and sensations. These technologies combine high-definition visuals, spatial audio, haptic feedback, and responsive interfaces to engage your senses and emotions.</p>
				<p>Whether you're exploring a virtual museum, attending a concert in the metaverse, walking through a real estate property online, or training for a job in a simulated environment, here's how it works:</p>
				<h3><strong>The Tech Behind the Magic</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>VR Headsets & Devices: </strong>Tools like Oculus, HTC Vive, or even smartphones transport users into fully immersive 3D environments.</p>
				<p><strong>AR Apps: </strong>Apps overlay digital elements onto the real world through your phone or smart glasses, enhancing your physical environment with interactive data or visuals.</p>
				<p><strong>3D Engines: </strong>Platforms like Unity or Unreal Engine build lifelike, interactive spaces where everything from lighting to movement is simulated in real time.</p>
				<p><strong>Cloud & Web Integration: </strong>Many virtual experiences are now accessible directly through browsers, no downloads, just instant access via the cloud.</p>
				<h3><strong>Why It's So Powerful</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>Emotional Impact: </strong>Virtual experiences aren't just visual, they're deeply emotional. They place you at the heart of the story or scenario.</p>
				<p><strong>Limitless Creativity: </strong>Anything imagined can be built, from fantastical worlds to perfect replicas of real-life places.</p>
				<p><strong>Real-Time Interaction: </strong>Users can engage, communicate, and collaborate within virtual environments just like in the real world.</p>

	<section class="accordion" id="How-do-electronic-cash-works">
		<h1 class="title"><a href="#How-do-electronic-cash-works">How do electronic cash works?</a></h1>
		<div class="content">
			<div class="wrapper">
				<p>In a world increasingly shaped by virtual experiences, gaming realms, simulations, immersive education, and augmented realities, there's a new kind of money emerging. One that doesn't rely on banks, networks, or even the internet.</p>
				<p><strong>It's offline. It's instantaneous. It's transferred with a QR code.</strong></p>
				<p>This is <strong>next-generation electronic cash,</strong> a digital currency built exclusively for virtual spaces, where value can be exchanged without touching the real-world financial system, and without being online.</p>
				<h3><strong>How It Works: The Power of QR-Based Cash</strong></h3>
				<p>1. <strong>Digital Creation</strong></p>
				<p>Electronic cash is generated by a virtual platform, like a game engine, metaverse, or closed digital ecosystem. Once created, it's loaded into a secure, local wallet on your device.</p>
				<p>2. <strong>Local Storage</strong></p>
				<p>Your e-cash exists entirely offline, embedded in your device. It can't be tracked, hacked through the internet, or blocked. Think of it like digital coins in your pocket, but for the virtual world.</p>
				<p>3. <strong>Transfer via QR Code</strong></p>
				<p>To send money, you simply <strong>display a QR code</strong> representing the exact amount and transaction data. The receiver <strong>scans it with their device</strong>, and the funds move directly from your wallet to theirs, peer-to-peer, no servers involved.</p>
				<p>No internet.</p>
				<p>No Bluetooth.</p>
				<p>No cloud. - Just a camera and a code.</p>
				<p>4. <strong>Built-In Trust & Security</strong></p>
				<p>Each QR code is cryptographically signed, making every transaction verifiable and tamper-proof. It's cash you can trust, without third parties.</p>
				<h3><strong>Why It's Game-Changing</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>Truly Offline: </strong>Works in remote or restricted digital environments. No need for Wi-Fi, cellular data, or connections of any kind.</p>
				<p><strong>Secure & Private: </strong>Every transfer is encrypted and anonymous, like physical cash, but smarter.</p>
				<p><strong>Instant & Intuitive: </strong>Fast QR scans make transactions frictionless. If you can point a camera, you can pay.</p>
				<p><strong>Tailored for Virtual Worlds: </strong>Perfect for games, simulations, metaverses, or any digital platform where immersive experience matters more than financial regulation.</p>
				<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
				<p>This isn't crypto. It's not fiat. It's <strong>cash made for digital worlds</strong>, fluid, portable, and free from online constraints.</p>
				<p><strong>Just scan and go.</strong> No connection required.</p>

		<h1 class="title"><a href="#The-e-cash-development-history">The E-Cash Development History</a></h1>
		<div class="content">
			<div class="wrapper">
				The <strong>E-Cash</strong> system is a descendant of several early electronic cash prototypes, originating from the <strong>PICF84MT13</strong> prototype developed in 2003 at AMA Computer College, Cagayan de Oro. This prototype utilized a <strong>PIC16F84</strong> microcontroller, powered by a lithium battery to preserve RAM data memory, and transferred electronic cash data through a single-wire interface, as well as LED-LDR and IR transmitter-receiver communication channels using UART assembly routines. Its firmware was written entirely in Assembly language.
				<div>
					<img src="assets/images/f84mt1314case.webp"/>
					<img src="assets/images/picinf84mt13.webp"/>
				</div>
				<br/>
				<strong>C Version (2004):</strong>
				<p>In 2004, the microcontroller assembly code was migrated to the Turbo C programming language for desktop computers (MS-DOS), as requested by the <strong>Land Bank of the Philippines</strong>. The transition was made for convenience, being more practical and easier to use than the handheld prototype microcontroller version, which was too bulky and impractical for real use.</p>
				<strong>Basic Version (2013):</strong>
				<p>The system was later translated into Visual Basic and integrated with MySQL for data storage. However, with Microsoft discontinuing support for Visual Basic in 2013, this version quickly became obsolete.</p>
				<strong>Python & JavaScript Version (2016):</strong>
				<p>With the rise of web applications and Python's popularity as an engineering-friendly language, the Turbo C source code was migrated to Python in 2016 for a proposal to Emirates NBD in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. However, Python proved unsuitable for hardware-level programming and failed to meet E-Cash requirements. Since Python code was often decompiled into either <strong>WebAssembly or JavaScript</strong>, the Python version was scrapped. The project was then fully rewritten in WebAssembly and JavaScript, ensuring greater efficiency and practicality.</p>
